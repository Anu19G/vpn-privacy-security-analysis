## VPN Privacy & Security Analysis

This project demonstrates the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting privacy and securing communication. It includes hands-on testing with **ProtonVPN** on Windows, using **WireGuard** and **OpenVPN** tunneling protocols, and network traffic analysis with **Wireshark**.

The tests highlight:
- VPN encryption mechanisms
- Privacy benefits
- Tunneling protocols comparison
- Network security improvements

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN** (Free plan)
- **Wireshark**
- **DNS Leak Test**
- **IP Leak Test**

---

## üìÇ Steps Performed
1. **Prepare ProtonVPN** for Windows.
2. Install and connect to ProtonVPN.
3. Identify tunneling protocol (WireGuard/OpenVPN).
4. Demonstrate VPN protection against traffic interception with Wireshark.
5. Compare WireGuard and OpenVPN protocol performance and packet structure.
